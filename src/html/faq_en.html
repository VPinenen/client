<h1 id="transferable">FAQ</h1>
<h2>Can a lost password be recovered? Can it be reset?</h2>
<p><b>No!</b> A password provides the only and the most important protection for your account and all its data. Choose a password with a higher degree of complexity and store it in a safe place as there are no means to recover it. If you lose your password, you will permanently lose all your data and nobody will ever be able to gain access to it. Please keep this in mind.</p>
<h2>How much does it cost?</h2>
<p>All of the tools we provide are made available to every user absolutely free of charge. A range of extended parameters is available for those using the paid services, although the basic functions in and of themselves ensure a user-friendly experience. You can learn more about our rate plans here.</p>
<h2>What applications have to be installed in order to be able to use your service?</h2>
<p>You do not need to install any additional applications. Our engine operates on all modern operating systems and mobile devices with an installed browser. We recommend always using the latest version of any chosen browser in order to ensure full compatibility and maximum performance of our code.</p>
<h2>What cryptographic algorithms do you use?</h2>
<p>Standard time-tested algorithms with proven encryption strength and maximum key sizes – <b>256-bit AES</b>, <b>4096-bit RSA</b>. We don’t see any need in limiting our users in terms of key size, so you can always enjoy the highest degree of protection no matter what rate plan you are on.</p>
<h2>In what way is your technology unique?</h2>
<p>We have designed a unique encrypted channels system, which essentially allows any number from one to X subscribers in a single channel to send messages to each other that are encrypted with the symmetric Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). The key from the channel is encoded with asymmetric RSA and is sent to all its subscribers when the channel is created. By removing or adding a subscriber or with any of the subscribers changing their password, a new channel is created with new access data (new invites are sent to each member). The sender’s signature must be verified when viewing all invitations, and where you have already connected your verification keys beforehand, you will not be able to change the invitation, which will be permanently valid. This approach yields huge efficiency, scalability and the possibility of developing an array of multiple services on our platform.</p>
<h2>What are aliases and what are they for?</h2>
<p>An alias is a synonym for one and the same account in our system. You can have a number of aliases and all the messages will be received by one and the same addressee. For example, if a company has to receive messages at </p>
<ul>
	<li>billing@your_domain.com
	<li>support@your_domain.com 
	<li>info@your_domain.com
</ul>
<p>it won’t have to check all three inboxes at the same time. This makes it far more convenient.</p>
<h2>How can I add an alias to an already existing name?</h2>
<p>By clicking on your address in the top right-hand corner of the interface (for a desktop computer) or opening the right-hand menu and selecting the Aliases item (for a mobile device), you can view a list of current names associated with your account, switch between them to send messages from a selected address or add a new alias. You can <a href="plans">read here</a> for details about limits on the number of aliases allowed for the various rate plans.</p>
<h2>Can I change my login once registered?</h2>
<p>No, your_login@safe.ad is unique and is created once when you create an account. However, you can add aliases to your account if you need several different names. The only exception is if you have linked your own domain name with our service. In this case, you can use the same logins for different domains. For example,</p>
<ul>
	<li>name@domain1.com
	<li>name@domain2.com
	<li>name@domain3.com
</ul>
<h2>To whom can I send messages?</h2>
<p>You can send messages to any inbox in the world. Nevertheless, you should bear in mind that when sending to an inbox that is not on our domain, you have two options: you could either send a link to an encrypted message or send an unsecured open text. If you choose the option with secured content and this will be the first message for this external email address (in all history of our service), you will be required to enter a password before sending, which you will have to transfer to the recipient by any safe channel (voice call, SMS message, online messengers, etc.). If you don’t let your recipient know the password, they won’t be able to read your message.</p>
<h2>What is the maximum message size?</h2>
<p>If you send an email in an open form to an external email address (standard), we have to limit its size to 25 Mb with all its attachments. This is not something we came up with. These are the standards for international exchange of electronic correspondence. We recommend sending an encrypted email. The size is a lot larger and the emails can be stored on our servers. Emails sent to an external address comprise of a short text and a link to your message in our system. In this case, only the size of the actual message is 10 Mb (text with graphics), whereas the overall size of attachments depends on your rate plan and can reach 100 Gb. Make sure to remember the password which you will have to enter before sending an encrypted email to an external address. The user will need it in order to read the email’s contents.</p>
<h2>What is the maximum size and number of files that can be sent in one message?</h2>
<p>These values are different depending on the chosen rate plans (<a href="plans">read here</a> for further details on rate plans), but we definitely are a way ahead of our competitors when it comes to intra-system message transfer. For instance, you can transfer files up to 100 Mb each (5 files in one message) even on the free rate plan. These limits are lifted for corporate clients, so any limits are then only the result of your device or browser capabilities.</p>
<h2>Where are your servers located?</h2>
<p>All data sent between our users is secured by modern encryption algorithms, utilizing maximum key sizes. There is absolutely no need to physically secure or conceal this data because data still cannot be decrypted even on gaining full access to it. We have confidence in our code and use our discretion in choosing where we store data. The most important factors for us are server speed and uptime.</p>
<h2>Can mail clients be used with your server?</h2>
<p>Currently, we do not provide this service for one simple reason: modern mail applications could not decrypt encrypted content from us even if they had it because their arsenal lacks the necessary tools. We are working on a plug-in for Outlook in order to resolve this issue and hope to soon be able to please our clients with this function.</p>
<h2>Is it possible to receive malicious content in messages sent to me?</h2>
<p>Our client code supports the modern Content Security Policy (CSP) technology, which prevents any kind of XSS attack when a message is being read. This works reliably in Chrome, Opera, Firefox, and Safari browsers. Unfortunately, this technology is not currently supported by the Internet Explorer browser, but we use additional content filtering if a browser does not support CSP. One thing can be said for sure—you can safely view any message. Nonetheless, we cannot monitor content of files sent to you (they are also encrypted just like all other message components) and you are solely responsible when opening such files. Please keep this in mind.</p>
<h2>Where is sent data encrypted and decrypted?</h2>
<p>All data sent within our server is encrypted on the sender’s device and is only decrypted on the recipient’s device, hence making data transfer totally secure. Regardless of where our servers or data channels are located, your messages and files cannot be decrypted at any stage of their transfer or storage.</p>
<h2>What data can you see on your servers?</h2>
<p>We encode all your personal data, including contact lists, data channels, and settings. All components of each message are encoded, including the subject, the contents and the attachments. The only things that can be read from the database are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>sent time of data,
	<li>a list of channel subscribers who have access to the data.
</ul>
<p>We do not even know who and to whom a message is sent. An encrypted body of files attached to a message is not linked to the message itself in any way other than by the sent time. Therefore, the link is lost when a large amount of data is sent and we may in future add a function so that files and their messages are added to the database at random times in order to blur the lines.</p>
<h2>How anonymous your service is? </h2>
<p>Our aim is not to provide an anonymous service, but to provide our clients with secure and unreadable communication. Nevertheless, we do not currently log personal data and do not require any personal data to be entered when signing up. The only exception is when an error occurs in trying to log into the system. In such cases, we save your IP address for 6 hours and ask you to enter a security captcha together with your username and password. We immediately delete your IP address from our database upon your successful login. If you require extended setting options, i.e. beyond those provided with the free rate plan, you can <a href="plans">purchase the premium plan</a>. We accept Bitcoin, thus guaranteeing you payment anonymity. You can read further about privacy <a href="privacy">here</a>.</p>
<h2>What security does my password provide?</h2>
<p>During sign-up or a password change, our system generates a new 4096-bit RSA keypair. Your password is then converted using a powerful algorithm into a form to enable encryption/decryption of your private key from the RSA-generated keypair. This is a standardized and secure process, which is supported by all modern and updated browsers and prevents guessing a password with the use of dictionary. Both keys (the untouched public key and the encrypted private key) are sent to the server for saving, where they are securely stored and sent to the user upon logging into the system. All of your data is linked to this keypair, so forgetting your password will make it impossible to recover your private RSA key, which is the most critical component in all cryptographic operations. All your RSA key history is linked in a chain, allowing access to data all the way back to when your started using the system. If a malicious third party gets ahold of your password, they can access all data until a new RSA keypair is generated (but not afterwards). For this reason, you are advised to regularly change your password and choose a strong one. We provide a gauge in all password input fields to signal the strength of the chosen password, so try to aim for the “medium” level at least.  For obvious reasons, your password is never sent to the server under any circumstance.</p>
<h2>What browsers are supported?</h2>

<h2>What is the difference between icon lock colors?</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><span class="i i-unlocked-small"></span> - Message is not absolutely secure, because it was in a raw form somewhere during the transfer. For example it was received from an external email service or sent outside in plain text form.</li>
		<li><span class="i i-locked-yellow-small"></span> - Message is secure (can't be read by third parties), but the recipient/sender of the message is not verified. (read more about contacts verification)</li>
		<li><span class="i i-locked-small"></span> - Message is absolutely secure and the recipient/sender of the message is well known.</li>
	</ul>
<p>Take a note, that <b>all the messages, files and other stuff are always stored on our servers encrypted</b>. But if you send a plain email message or receive any correspondense from outer source, they can easily get access to your content.</p>
<h2>Where can I view the source code for your application?</h2>
<p>Our application’s code is open-source for you to study, analyze, criticize and enhance. You can learn more about the latest version at <a href="https://github.com/safead/client" target="_blank">our GitHub page</a>, and get actively involved in its development and in tracing for critical errors. We’re relying on all those getting involved who want to champion the right to private communication and believe they deserve to have a private life that is free from the intrusion of government institutions, advertising agencies and third parties. We have created a platform on which we are going to develop a plethora of useful applications with your help, from encrypted video conferences to a new generation of social network. We are ready to partner, so <a href="signup">join us!</a></p>
<h2>How secure and reliable is your service?</h2>
<p>We are living in an era of dizzying technological progress, characterized by incredible rates of technological development. The internet is the most dynamically developing medium, with all its upsides and downsides, its revolutions and crashes. There is not a single device in the world than can be said with 100% confidence to be secure and hack-proof. We have created an algorithm which is secure, versatile and progressive, but if you have someone lurking behind you with a video camera or your computer is infected by viruses that log your every key stroke, no algorithm in the world will ever help you. If you are interested in our service, you should at least have a basic knowledge of how to keep your computer in order and take certain steps to do so. It also means that you have the basic know-how allowing you to protect your electronic space and reserve it exclusively for yourself. For our part, we can say one thing—our service is only secure to the extent that your device is secure. If your password does not fall into unwanted hands and malicious persons are not allowed to change the client application, then you have 101% security. On our part, we are devising steps to keep you protected from phishing and other similar hacking techniques. In our view, the best solution for preventing attacks is installing a plug-in for your browser with its own electronic signature, which prevents code from being changed on our server, and using two-factor authentication.</p>
<h2>How is encrypted email sent to an external email address?</h2>
<p>When you send an encrypted email to an external address for the first time, a complete account for this address is created in our system. This account can only be logged into via a link contained in the email that is sent and by using a password created by the sender. When later sending an encrypted email to the same address, the email is associated with the now already existing account and the password is also the same as before. The recipient will need to know the password created when an email is sent (so do not forget to send it via an independent channel) and can log into their account following any of the links contained in any email sent. It is very important that the recipient creates an alias for further logging into the system and changes their password (which you know as the creator of the account) upon logging into their account for the first time. Changing the password and adding an alias are the two most important actions that a person following an email link should carry out upon their first login.</p>
<h2>Do you delete accounts after a period of inactivity?</h2>
<p>No, we do not track your activity and do not delete accounts that you have not logged into for a long time. If you want to delete your account, you can do this manually under Settings.</p>
<h2>I have received spam from one of your mail boxes. What should I do?</h2>
<p>If you have received a nuisance email (spam, phishing etc.) from one of our domains or a domain linked to our service, please notify us at <a href="mailto:abuse@safe.ad">abuse@safe.ad</a> or <a href="contact">contact us via our secure feedback form</a>. Include the text from the email or a screenshot and the sender’s address. We are quick to respond, and will add the sender to the blacklist and block the associated account.</p>
<h2>What is Secure Feedback? What is the purpose of it?</h2>
<p>All website owners would like to receive feedback from visitors using their resources. Most modern engines used to power interactive online resources comprise embedded tools for sending comments and forms for communicating with resource owners, etc. However, the data sent via these embedded tools is not confidential. Even when there is a secure connection to the website using an https protocol, the data is open on the recipients’ servers. There are many instances when information sent to you should be 100% safeguarded against third party viewing, such as with patient medical data, company financial reports, legal documents, articles from news agencies or technical designs which need to remain confidential.</p>
<h2>What new functions can we expect in the near future?</h2>
<p>Development of the mobile application is in full swing. It will be available in the upcoming months for every device operating with iOS or Android. This stage is set to be followed by a messenger, and then by encrypted audio and video communication. At the same time, we will be developing a file repository, adding extended functions and modules for corporate clients (data storage on own servers with unlimited capacity, creating file revision history for workgroups, etc.), and will be actively responding to all your requests and suggestions. If you have ideas, then we will definitely try to make them happen, so please <a href="contact">send us your feedback!</a></p>
<br />
<p>For such cases, we have created the simple and reliable Secure Feedback form (looks exactly like ours <a href="contact">contact support form</a>), which is a feedback form that uses end-to-end encryption. Data sent by a site visitor is encrypted on their computer and may be read only by the recipient in our system. The process of installing the code on your web resource is very simple and takes just a few minutes. No specialist skills are needed to connect our secure communications form. We have no limits for our users on the number of feedback forms that can be installed, so you can generate different forms on every page of your website or simply one on each of your sites. It’s entirely up to you.</p>
<h2>How can I contact you?</h2>
