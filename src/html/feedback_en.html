<h1 id="transferable">Safe Feedback</h1>
<h3>What is it and how to use it</h3>
<p>All website owners would like to receive feedback from visitors using their resources. Most modern engines used to power interactive online resources comprise embedded tools for sending comments and forms for communicating with resource owners, etc. However, the data sent via these embedded tools is not confidential. Even when there is a secure connection to the website using an https protocol, the data is open on the recipients’ servers. There are many instances when information sent to you should be 100% safeguarded against third party viewing, such as with patient medical data, company financial reports, legal documents, articles from news agencies or technical designs which need to remain confidential.</p>
<br />
<p>For such cases, we have created the simple and reliable Secure Feedback form (looks exactly like ours <a href="contact">contact support form</a>), which is a feedback form that uses end-to-end encryption. Data sent by a site visitor is encrypted on their computer and may be read only by the recipient in our system. The process of installing the code on your web resource is very simple and takes just a few minutes. No specialist skills are needed to connect our secure communications form. We have no limits for our users on the number of feedback forms that can be installed, so you can generate different forms on every page of your website or simply one on each of your sites. It’s entirely up to you.</p>
